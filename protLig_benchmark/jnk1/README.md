## Summary ##
This is a collection of the input files for 13 protein-ligand systems (482 ligand perturbations):

## Protein structures and topologies: ##
  In the original publication the structures from `protein_amber` and `protein_charmm` were used. These, however, by mistake contained 8 doubly protonated histidines, while Maestro prediction suggested only 4 of them to be doubly protonated. The corrected structures and topologies are in `protein_amber_fixed_HIS_protonation` and `protein_charmm_fixed_HIS_protonation`.
