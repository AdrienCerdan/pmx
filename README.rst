pmx: alchemistry in gromacs
===========================

**Warning:** this is a development version of ``pmx``, it is not stable or reliable yet. You are welcome to 
try/test it and provide feedback, but use at your own risk. The current stable version of ``pmx`` can
be found here: https://github.com/dseeliger/pmx

``pmx`` is a python library that allows users to setup and analyse molecular
dynamics simulations with the `Gromacs <http://gromacs.org>`_ package.
Among its main features are the setup and analysis of alchemical free energy
calculations for protein, nucleic acid, and small molecule mutations.
